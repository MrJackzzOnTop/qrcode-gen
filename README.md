# QrCode-Gen
This is a simple QR-Code generator that I made in python, you can add a text or an URL for your QR image, its a very simple tool to use.

First make sure to install the requirements using the command: pip install -r requirements.txt
If does not work try to create a environment on python to install the requirements or open an ticket Issue to let me check what is the problem.
